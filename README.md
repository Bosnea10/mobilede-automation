# mobilede-automation

This thesis investigates the concepts of automation and optimization using UiPath
technology, which is part of the Robotic Process Automation (RPA) domain. RPA
facilitates the development, deployment, and management of software applications
that mimic human actions in the interaction with digital systems, doing so more
quickly and consistently than humans. The paper automates the processes of searching, filtering and sorting cars on the mobile.de website. Filters are received via
email and selected in the site after which an Excel report is generated with the cars
matching the selected criteria. The report is then sent back to the user as an attachment to a mail. The purpose of this application is to significantly reduce the time
and effort required for searching cars on the site.
The first chapter introduces the problem and the objectives of the thesis.
In the second chapter I explain the technologies related to RPA and UiPath, providing some background for the research.
The third chapter takes a closer look to the tools used throughout the application .
In the fourth chapter are presented the functional requirements, the architecture and
the workflow of the entire automation process. I provided detailed steps as to how
the application runs and done a comparison between the human and the automated
method.
The fifth and last chapter discusses he outcomes of the implementation, including
the benefits and challenges encountered.
In order to write the application that support my paper I used the Robotic Enterprise
Framework provided by UiPath. This Framework offers significant advantages for
building automations. Its modularity and reusability allow developers reuse a lot of
the used components, leading to more efficient development and maintenance. The
framework also contains some mechanism for error handling and recovery which
ensures reliable automation.
All in all with the help of this paper I present a case study of how automation can
transform and optimize user interactions with online systems and also I am providing a practical solution that can be adapted to similar scenarios in various domains.
